## Technologies Used

* 📄 HTML5
* 💅 SASS ➡️ CSS3 (thanks to Live Sass Compiler by Ritwick Dey)
* 👨🏻‍🎨 Adobe Illustrator (comps/planning/writing)
* 🅰️ All fonts and icons designed by me in Georg Seifert's _superb_  [Glyphs.app](https://glyphsapp.com) 💚💚💚

## Description

School project at Epicodus: A static website focusing on css styling and broad coverage of common HTML tags.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/jeremybanka/programming-portfolio`
* Open `index.html` in your favorite web browser
* If you want to play with the code, make sure you're running Ritwick Dey's Live Sass Compiler. Otherwise your changes to the `scss` won't take effect!

## Known Bugs

* The css for the responsive layout isn't broken but it's definitely awkward and a little sloppy.
* The body text font is lacking working parentheses, so I've just avoided using them.

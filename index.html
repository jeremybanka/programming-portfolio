            A Javascript library I designed to process colors into useful, related colors making color palette design an expedient and easy process. It uses a unique form of HSL Color modeling that reflects the limits of a hue's saturation relative to its brightness, or vice versa.

            A React app I built to serve as an implementation of my color derivation library, luum, in two ways. The first way is to give non-developers a comfy GUI for creating, previewing, and exporting color palettes. The second way is to give developers an example of using luum 'live' to shade and tint a user interface made with any background color.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beware! The GUI is far from 'comfy' in its present state. But it is still pretty cool, though definitely confusing and a bit slow to run until compiled.

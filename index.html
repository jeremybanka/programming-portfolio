            A Javascript library I designed to process colors into useful, related colors making color palette design an expedient and easy process. It uses a unique form of HSL Color modeling that reflects the limits of a hue's saturation relative to its brightness, or vice versa.

            A React app I built to serve as an implementation of my color derivation library, luum, in two ways. The first way is to give non-developers a comfy GUI for creating, previewing, and exporting color palettes. The second way is to give developers an example of using luum 'live' to shade and tint a user interface made with any background color.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beware! The GUI is far from 'comfy' in its present state. But it is still pretty cool, though definitely confusing and a bit slow to run until compiled.

            Front-end design is really what attracts me about development, but ideally I want to develop skills as a full-stack developer, so I can have a more holistic understanding of modern software and how it functions. Long-term in the industry, I could see working either as a front-end lead or a product owner in an agile development team.

            Education, however, may prove an irresistable career path for me. I love helping others learn almost as much as I love learning itself. I have had a blast going through HTML+CSS concepts with my teammates here and it's my absolute pleasure to help them start their journey with web markup.  In my graphic design cohort, most other students burned out quickly on our curriculum's cursory coverage of 'roll-your-own' web design, so the opportunity to share this knowledge with others on a daily basis is just thrilling.
